\f0\fs24 \cf0 In the last class, we focused on data representation, particularly numeric systems. We explored the decimal system, which is the standard base-10 system we use in daily life. The class also delved into binary, a base-2 system that computers use to process information. Additionally, we covered hexadecimal, a base-16 system commonly used in programming and digital electronics. The lecture provided a deeper understanding of how these numeric systems are applied in computing and data storage.}
