January 23 - The class focused on Linux and Unix operating systems. Linux is designed similarly to Unix but allows user contributions. A key distinction is that Linux is free and open-source.

January 30 - The lesson centered on data understanding, specifically binary and decimal numbers. Binary is a format that computers use to understand data. We also discussed how to convert numbers between binary and decimal, as well as converting negative numbers.

February 4 - The topic covered XML Schema, which defines the core components of an XML document. We also compared Mind Maps and Concept Maps. A Mind Map revolves around a central theme, while a Concept Map connects multiple related topics. Additionally, we learned about REST (Representational State Transfer), an architectural style for communication between computer systems on the web.

February 6 - The class focused on statements, including declarations, definitions, assignments, and control structures like if-else, for, while, and do-while loops. We also covered basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and modulo.

February 11 - We continued with arithmetic operations and began learning about arrays. An array is a collection of elements of the same type, allowing efficient storage and manipulation of multiple values with a single variable name and index.

February 13 - We revisited binary-to-decimal conversions and vice versa. The class also included our first quiz.

February 18 - We learned about strings, which are used to store characters. We also studied the fgets() function, which is used to read file contents.

February 20 - The class covered bitwise operations and pointers. Bitwise operations manipulate individual bits of a number at the binary level (0s and 1s), and they are faster than arithmetic operations. A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

February 25 - We started the class by discussing the project and its requirements, including functional specifications and documentation. Then we explored sizeof and strlen. sizeof is an operator that returns the memory size (in bytes) of a variable, data type, or array, including the null character for strings. strlen is a function that calculates the length of a string (number of characters before \0).

February 27 - We began studying threads. A thread enables a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which enhances efficiency and performance.

March 4 - We continued learning about threads, understanding their purpose and reviewing examples. Threads allow tasks to run in parallel instead of sequentially, improving CPU utilization.

March 6 - We had a guest lecture focused on product development, discussing various examples. The lecture primarily centered on understanding requirements using the five Ws: What, When, Who, Why, and How.

April 1 During class, we learned about structures in C and how to implement them. Structures allow grouping different data types under one name, making programs more organized and efficient. We practiced defining, initializing, and accessing structure members, which is useful for handling complex data. This knowledge will help to write better-structured code, especially for engineering and real-world applications.

April 3, 8, 10- In the last few classes, we covered Finite State Machines (FSM) and practiced related exercises to strengthen our understanding writing program for traffic light. We also created our own version of the string.h library and worked with functions like strlen and strcpy to manipulate strings, also used replace and swap functions to change letters in a text.

April 15, 17 - During this two classes we made PRD for our projects with Ms Satenik and commented each other's drafts giving feedback. We also finalized our projects' ideas.
